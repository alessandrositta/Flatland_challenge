# Flatland Challenge
![](trains.gif)
> The Flatland Challenge is a competition to foster progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning for any re-scheduling problem (RSP) :link: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/flatland-challenge.

> The repository contains our solutions with relative code to the problem presented in the challenge.

## 1. Dueling Double DQN
![](Model.png)
> The proveded solution has been developed using a Dueling Double DQN. The basic idea has been taken from the two papers :scroll: http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3964-double-q-learning.pdf :scroll: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581.

## 2. Single Agent
![](SingleAgent.gif)
> The first interesting solutions concentrats on the Single Agnet case, in which a single train needs to learn how to reach a target in a simple framework. Traning, tests and results using different techniques are included in the reository and discussed deeply in the paper (mettere link a paper). 

## 3. Multi Agent
> Different methods have been used to perform training and testing from 3 up to 10 agents in different environments. For further details refer to the paper (mettere link a paper).
