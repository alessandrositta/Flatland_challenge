# Flatland Challenge
![](Images/trains.gif)
> The Flatland Challenge is a competition to foster progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning for any re-scheduling problem (RSP) :link: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/flatland-challenge.

> The repository contains our solutions with relative code to the problem presented in the challenge.

## 1. Dueling Double DQN
![](Images/Model.png)
> The provided solution has been developed using a Reinforcement Learning approach and in particular a Dueling Double DQN. The basic idea has been taken from the two papers :scroll: http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3964-double-q-learning.pdf :scroll: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581.

## 2. Single Agent
![](Images/SingleAgent.gif)
> The first interesting solutions have been developed on the Single Agnet case, in which a single train needs to learn how to reach a target in a simple framework. Traning, tests and results using different techniques are included in the reository and discussed deeply in the [Complete Paper](Project_Flatland.pdf). 

## 3. Multi Agent

> Different methods have been used to perform training and testing from 3 up to 10 agents in different environments, including malfunctions and different trains' velocities. For further details refer to the [Complete Paper](Project_Flatland.pdf).

## 4. Final Results
A summary of the final results obtained during the project is provided in the tables:

The Medium size and Big size maps are of the kind:

Further details on the dimensions and complexity of the maps as well as the metrics involved, can be found in the [Complete Paper](Project_Flatland.pdf).

## Contacts :speech_balloon:
The project has been developed by Giovanni Montanari, Lorenzo Sarti and Alessandro Sitta (me) in the context of the course "Deep Learning" at the University of Bologna.
